title: A quick introduction!

Hello! For my first post on this site I thought I would just give an overview of who I am and what I enjoy. I'm Rachael and I am a student at Queen's University Belfast studying an undergraduate MEng in Computer Science. I've mainly focused on software development including cloud development, machine learning and data analytics to name a few. However to get more experience with some web dev I've put together a portfolio site, which you can view [here.](https://www.rachaelcoulter.com)

I have just completed by placement year with SAP Belfast where I focused on software development for their cloud model. Since then I have spent the summer working on my own projects and taking part in Kainos' AI Camp. We spent a fortnight disocvering machine learning and then had an 8 hour hackathon to produce a prototype to change the local health, education or social sector. I developed the concept of 'Catalyst' - a means of matching potential employees to their dream job, based on jobs which others like them enjoy. I led our team of three to develop a prototype and led the pitch in front of four industry experts. We were over the moon to win 1st place!

After my success at AI Camp I was asked to speak on a panel for BBC Ulster on the topic of Artificial Intelligence and its impact on Northern Ireland. This was an incredible experience and one I won't forget! You can have a listen [here.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08zczv1) I also enjoyed taking part in the first Immersive Tech NI Hackathon last winter. I came up with a concept of a VR training simulation for road vehicle safety checks and our team (which we only formed that morning!) produced a prototype which Glenn demoed while I pitched to a panel of judges. We finished third overall and were thrilled with what we accomplished in such a short time.

Outside of technology I am also a National level Dressage rider who has represented Ireland both on teams and individually for the past four years. My horse Maya is my best friend and we compete together at Advanced Medium level with the dream of competing in a tailcoat one day at Prix St Georges. Our highlights include two team silver medals and an individual bronze at the British Youth Dressage Home International representing Ireland and winning the Pony Club National Open Dressage Championship after winning the Northern Ireland qualifier. I have a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/trcdressage/) if you are interested! I also run recreationally, recently achieving my goal of a sub-25 minute 5k!

I hope this gives you an idea of who I am! I hope to keep this blog up to date with my tech projects and meetups - thanks for reading!
