title: 100 Days of Coding&#58 Day 1
---

I have decided to take part in the 100 days of code challenge for 2018! Between uni, work, sports and other obligations my time to work on my own projects often gets neglected, so I have decided to combat this by allocating an hour every day for the next 100 days to work on my own projects, do research and in general discover new aspects of the tech industry that I haven't get gotten my teeth stuck into.


<h2>Task</h2>
Update my portfolio website

**Today's Progress**: Added a new row of tiles to faciliate adding in more updates. Moved all existing tiles down to allow for new updates to be at the top of the page in the two feature tiles.

**Thoughts**: I need to re-do the colour scheme, with the extra tiles the existing scheme looks messy. Also the line at the top of the page is broken, slightly out of line. I'll fix this in the next few days.

**TODO**:
* Add new updates to site
* Re-do colour scheme
* Fix line at top of page
* Add logo for link to blog rather than text
