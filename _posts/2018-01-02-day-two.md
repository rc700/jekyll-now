<h2>Task</h2>
Update my portfolio website

**Today's Progress**: Added in new tiles with new updates about my work done and accomplishments to date. Wrote blurbs and found photos for these tiles.

**Thoughts**: Did some research on colour schemes but have not yet decided which one to settle for.

**TODO**:
* Re-do colour scheme
* Fix line at top of page
* Add logo for link to blog rather than text
