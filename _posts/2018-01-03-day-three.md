title: 100 Days of Coding&#58 Day 3 - Git and I fall out
---

<h2>Task</h2>
Update my portfolio website

**Today's Progress**: Thought this would be an easy day, just modify the colour scheme and then fix the bug with the line on the top of the page. Oh no. Somehow I managed to be an idiot with git and lost all of yesterday's work. No worries, re-did the work from yesterday. Then git wasn't happy with the name of an image, no problem I'll rename it. Git yet again wasn't happy so I tried to unstage the folder from the commit to re-add it with the new image names. Stupid idea, the entire folder deleted from my PC.
Great. A few deep breaths later and re-creating the images I had lost, I was back on track. Now the new updates have been added to the site, new colourscheme has been finalised and tomorrow I should be able to get the last few bugs fixed. Maybe, depends if Git and I are friends again.

**Thoughts**: Git is a powerful beast but for sure needs treated with respect.

**TODO**:
* Fix line at top of page
* Add logo for link to blog rather than text
