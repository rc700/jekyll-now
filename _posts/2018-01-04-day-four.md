title: 100 Days of Coding&#58 Day 4 - Why do the miniscule things in life take the most time?

**Task**:  Update my portfolio website

**Today's Progress**: Added logo for link to blog, fixed broken line at top of page, cleaned up source code.

**Thoughts**: On paper this sounds like 10 minutes of work, but the nightmare of trying to get that tiny line on the page to sit with the correct margins and to have the logo just where I wanted it will haunt me for weeks.

**TODO**:
* Add more social media links both to pop-up windows and to the bottom of the site

**Images**
